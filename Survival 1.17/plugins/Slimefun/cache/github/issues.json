📔 Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ⭐ Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a date assigned to them.\r\nBut the majority of milestones are still to far away to even have a date ready here.\r\nThose are marked as *TBD* (to be decided).\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Type of change |\r\n| :---: | :------- |\r\n| 🔧 | Technical change / API |\r\n| 🎈 | New Features |\r\n| 💡 | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (Q3 2021) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3131\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (Q3/Q4 2021) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### 🎈(Q4 2021) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (Q4 2021) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Updating to Java 16\r\nSlimefun will *eventually* update to Java 16 in the future.\r\nWe will give a proper announcement on when this will happen though.\r\nThere isn't any rush as we will wait until a large majority of servers have already upgraded.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Ticker rewrite\r\nThanks to @LinoxGH and @md5sha256 our ticker system will be rewritten to be much more reliable.\r\nThis will also include some API changes that are yet to be added, you can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2996\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) BlockStorage system rewrite\r\nThe \"block-storage\" system will be rewritten, the API will change drastically and we will open it up for much more efficient storage methods, this will do a lot in regards to stability and performance in the long-run.\r\nYou can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2792\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (TBD) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better! We will be stripping the data of an android from its block and give it a unique identity instead.\r\nThe UI will be completely redone and it will have much better performance. Oh, and you will be able to give other players access to your android and configure their permissions.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Changes to the config system and perhaps a reload command\r\nWe haven't fully decided on this one yet but you can follow the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2822\r\n\r\n### 💡 (TBD) Cargo networks rewrite\r\nWhere do we even start here... It needs a rewrite, nuff said.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🎉 Feedback\r\nWe are always looking for feedback!\r\nIf you have something to suggest, check out our discord server @ https://discord.gg/slimefun and visit `#suggestions`.\r\nWe are always eager to see what the community wants or doesn't want.\r\nIf you are a developer and have questions or concerns regarding some of the more technical changes, simply post your question in `#programming-help` and we will get back to you!\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3167","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3167/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3167/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3167/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3167","id":941206301,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg3MTUxMjQw","number":3167,"title":"Fix renamed items turning into valid-ish items for crafting purposes","user":{"login":"martinbrom","id":16322387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzIyMzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16322387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom","html_url":"https://github.com/martinbrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinbrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"✨ Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-07-10T08:48:49Z","updated_at":"2021-07-10T10:31:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/3167","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3167","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3167.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3167.patch"},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nWhite items would be \"similar\" to renamed items used on an AncientAltar for the purposes of crafting.

This Pull Request will **not** be merged anytime soon.\r\nPlease read carefully.\r\n\r\n### 1. Why... why do you do this to us? 😢 \r\nAs you know, Slimefun is an ever-growing, ever-expanding project.\r\nIt has grown steadily since over 8 years and is constantly being rewritten over and over again.\r\nWith so many people working on the project, mistakes happen.\r\nSlimefun has a reputation and bad code practices is a part of that.\r\nWe have made many bad design decisions over these 8 years, though frankly which developer hasn't over such a long time period.\r\n\r\nWe are also constantly working on improving the codebase and getting rid of these bad decisions by refactoring the codebase.\r\nAnd we almost did our best to avoid breaking changes within the many dependents of the project, most noteworthy the many addons that exist for Slimefun.\r\nHowever sometimes we find ourselves in a corner. A corner from which we cannot escape without breaking changes.\r\nAnd we have reached many corners like that.\r\n\r\n### 2. What has changed? 😨\r\nI will try my best to sum up all the things that have changed within the API, so you can prepare accordingly.\r\nWe changed our package signature from `me.mrCookieSlime.Slimefun` to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4` a while ago.\r\nBut there are still a lot of classes who have missed the move, because they would break the API.\r\n\r\n1. `Category` has been renamed to `ItemGroup`.\r\n2. All Category / ItemGroup variants have been relocated to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.api.items.groups`\r\n3. The `SlimefunItem` class has been relocated to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.api.items`\r\n4. The `SlimefunItemStack` class has been relocated to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.api.items`\r\n5. The `ItemHandler` class has been relocated to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.api.items`\r\n6. The `RecipeType` class has been relocated to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.api.recipes`\r\n7. Research classes have been moved from `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.core.researching` to `io.github.thebusybiscuit.slimefun4.api.researches`\r\n8. The main class `SlimefunPlugin` was renamed to `Slimefun`\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, any method signatures that involved the aforementioned classes was also updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere is also a huge refactoring for the shaded `cscorelib2` artifact upcoming.\r\nThis will be added to this huge pull request in the coming weeks, the cscorelib2 api packages will be renamed and relocated as well.\r\n\r\n### 3. Will this open up any new possibilities? 🤞🏻\r\nNot immediately.\r\nBut it helps us get long-overdue changes done.\r\nThis way, we can safely work on all the other API changes we are working on.\r\nThe following things are still to come:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Rewrite of the recipe system\r\n- [ ] Rewrite of the Programmable androids\r\n- [ ] Rewrite of the Inventory system\r\n- [ ] Rewrite of the Research system\r\n- [ ] Rewrite of our BlockStorage system\r\n\r\nWe believe these changes can be done without much breakage, but getting these bunch of design mistakes out of the way, let's us focus on the more important rewrites again.\r\n\r\n### 4. Why do you not merge this anyway? 😈\r\nNooooooooooooo.\r\nWe aren't that evil - mostly.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to be transparent about these changes and ask you and all addon developers out there.\r\nWe want to know:\r\na) When is the best time to merge these, so you can prepare.\r\nb) Any other changes you want us to do now?\r\n\r\nThe second question might seem weird at first. But this large refactoring is also the perfect oppurtunity for change.\r\nRight now, you have complete creative freedom over how the API's future will change.\r\nChanges we would normally reject because they could break something, can now be integrated (maybe).\r\n\r\nSo please, engage in conversations below this pull request. Tell us your thoughts, opinions and suggest other changes we should make.\r\n\r\n### 5. What can I do to prepare my addon? 😕\r\nOnce a date has been settled, make sure to be ready to update as soon as possible.\r\nIn the meantime, you can compile the `breaking-changes/class-relocation` branch of Slimefun4 and see how your addon will break, so you are prepared.\r\n\r\nAlso make sure that your Auto-Updater works and that your plugin does not get shutdown when Slimefun's api breaks.\r\nBy ensuring that the Auto-Updater still works, you can push updates without servers needing to update your addon manually to fix the issue.\r\nIt may not be the best practice but using a `try/catch` here and simply logging the exception is an option.\r\nThis way, the Auto-Updater can still do its thing, even if no item could be loaded.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3138","id":930435069,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njc4MTI1MDQ4","number":3138,"title":"Fix

But if output chest already full, and compressor is processing items, the items will go to compressor instead\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Fill output chest with items(in this case, example: carbon) until almost full\r\n2. Get coal block more than enough for crafting carbon\r\n3. Right click the compressor\r\n\r\n\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nWhen output chest is full and the compressor is still processing, the items will go to compressor.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots /

don't see any reason as to why the current workflow couldn't be automated.\r\nRight now, I manually pull the `master` branch into the `stable` branch and then file a new release with the new name, git hash and copy/paste the description and everything.\r\n\r\nThe `workflow_dispatch` event also allows for parameters to be inserted and the creation of releases and pulling of branches can both be achieved via existing actions, given an access token.\r\nSo this should be easy to automate, I sadly have a lot to do at work and uni at the moment, so I would love it if someone could PR this.\r\n\r\nFor the `workflow_dispatch` trigger, we would need the following parameters:\r\n- Date of release (e.g. `20 Jun 2021`)\r\n- Name of tag (e.g. `RC-25`)\r\n\r\nand a copy/pasta variant of

I was wondering if there is a way to unload the various slimefun blocks, instead of just saving them, as happens now.\r\n\r\nOr a help where you simply tell me mainly the classes that I should touch/look at in order to understand how to fix the problem... for now I have tried to fix the networks, I actually managed to do it, at least that's what I hoped for... but the problem persists...\r\n\r\n\r\n(I solved the problem of networks by unloading them when the world is unloaded (onWorldUnload event), using the method provided)\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\nto reproduce this problem you need 1 plugin that allows you to Unloose and load worlds (like SlimeWorld or MultiverseCore)\r\n\r\n1) at startup place slimefun blocks in a new world (not the main one!), create 1 network (cargo or Energy) and the furnaces that generate electricity (i.e. the head)\r\n\r\n2) Unload the world with /mv unload worldName or /swm unload worldName (make sure there is nobody in this world when you do these commands!)\r\n\r\n3) Wait a few minutes and reload the world with /mv load worldName or /swm load worldName.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\ndepends on what you place, I found errors in the console (in the case of the furnaces that generate electricity, due to lack of network) or simply the various blocks stop working properly (since are duplicated, or unusable due to the existence of a duplicate router)\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nYatopia\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.16.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nI use a recoding of the v4.9 \n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nAdvancedSlimeWorldManager","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","id":899857016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTk4NTcwMTY=","number":3076,"title":"Slimefun and PyroMining incompatibility ","user":{"login":"ItsSynchro","id":16171807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTcxODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16171807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsSynchro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."},{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2021-05-24T17:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T16:33:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nUpon using PyroMining and Slimefun, individuals are able to obtain PyroMining items if they break ores with a pickaxe that they don't have researched.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain what you changed/added and why you did it in detail. -->\r\nThis pull request adds the `SoundService` and the `SoundEffect` enum which allow us to easily play sounds\r\nbut also allow server owners to easily configure and customize sounds.\r\nNote here that I opted for the minecraft-ids of sounds rather than the bukkit constants because this will allow\r\nserver owners to use completely custom sounds in combination with resource packs.\r\nIf a sound does not exist, the player will simply not hear anything, no error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen values are misconfigured, a helpful warning will appear in the console.\r\nThis will also protect us against Mojang sound changes in the future, as we don't have to worry about the support of changed enum constants or such.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the new config file:\r\n```yaml\r\nPORTABLE_CRAFTER_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.wolf.howl\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 0.123456789\r\nSPLINT_CONSUME_SOUND:\r\n  sound: entity.skeleton.hurt\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\nTRASH_CAN_OPEN_SOUND:\r\n  sound: i.dont.exist.btw.spinach.sucks.and.pineapple.on.pizza.rules\r\n  volume: 1.0\r\n  pitch: 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ToDo (Why this is still a draft)\r\n* [x] MockBukkit does not support String-sounds atm, so Unit Tests will fail, I will need to update MockBukkit for that first\r\n* [ ] I would like to add Unit Tests for this sound service too\r\n* [ ] Not all sounds have been converted yet\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you should follow. -->\r\n<!-- You can click those check boxes after you posted your issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have fully tested the proposed changes and promise that they will not break everything into chaos.\r\n- [x] I have also tested the proposed changes in combination with various popular addons and can confirm my changes do not break them.\r\n- [x] I followed the existing code standards and didn't mess up the formatting.\r\n- [x] I did my best to add documentation to any public classes or methods I added.\r\n- [x] I have added `Nonnull` and `Nullable` annotations to my methods to indicate their behaviour for null values\r\n- [ ] I added sufficient Unit Tests to cover my code.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/2835","id":814068423,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTQwNjg0MjM=","number":2835,"title":"Default

Create a simple cargo setup consisting of one cargo manager, one cargo input node and one cargo output node\r\n2. Configure the cargo system in such way that it is transferring items into a slimefun managed inventory container, such as the \"Electric Furnace\"\r\n3.

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T17:53:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
